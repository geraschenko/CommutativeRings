# CommutativeRings

These are my notes from UC Berkeley Math 274, Commutative Rings, taught by [Tsit Yuen Lam](https://math.berkeley.edu/~lam) in Fall 2006.

During the course, professor Lam handed out notes. It seemed like he was close
to completing a book on the subject. I'm not sure what became of the project.
His notes included exercises, and students in the class could submit solutions
through me. I guess I was running the course web site. This was a long time
ago, so I don't remember the details very well :-).
